		<blockquote><P>UGA in recent years has gone through a bit of a dry spell. In fact, as of last year it became so bad that the athletic director</P></blockquote>
		<p>believed that we needed a new head coach all together. This past season, we were able to pick up the highly successful Alabama </p>
		<p>defensive coordinator and former UGA football player, Kirby Smart. While this current season we have had struggles facing lesser</p>
		<p>teams, it is important for us to remember that even Nick Saban, one of the most successful college coaches in this era, started his</p>
		<p>first season with Alabama with a 7-6 record. This isn't even begining to mention the fact that he is also working with a true freshman</p>
		<p>quaterback and primary wide receiver. Given our record and the tallent that Smart is working with, I think we are on the road to a</p>
		<p>BSC championship within the next 5 years.

			<li>Kirby Smart is an excellent recruiter.
			<ol>
			<li>Kirby is still dealing with a Mark Richt recruited team.</li>
			<li>Once he begins to recruit his own team our preformance will improve.</li>
			</ol>
			</li>
			<li>Kirby knows the ins and outs of Alabama's defense.
			<ol>
			<li>The winner of the SEC West is almost always Alabama.</li>
			<li>The winner of the SEC championship (west v. east) always goes to the BCS Bowl.</li>
			<li>Knowing how to beat Alabama almost guarentees a trip to the BCS Bowl.</li>
			</ol>
			</li>
			<li>All other non-SEC schools are trash and won't stand a chance against a real football team.</li>
